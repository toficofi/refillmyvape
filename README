A little Puppeteer script to automate the re-ordering of vape refill bottles.

Given a list of preferred flavours, it will find the options that are in stock and add them to your basket.

If too many items are out of stock, it will order multiple of the same flavour.

Made this one evening to save about 2 minutes a month!
